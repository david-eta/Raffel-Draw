# Raffel-Draw
Used PyQt5 to create a GUI that randomly selected a name from a text file as the winner of a raffle draw.


# Purpose
A friend, who had a business, wnated to promote it while rewarding one of his lucky customers. He did so by 
organising this raffle draw with a reward of a ticket to see the Marvel Movie, Endgame.

# The List of Names
The names were the customers who had bought his products within a certain time. The names were repeated the
number of times they bought a product. Hence, increasing the likelihood of a customer winning based on
how much they patronised him.

# Looking back
As you can tell by the reward, this program was created quite a while ago. Looking back, I would now 
center-align the names based on the length of the names.
